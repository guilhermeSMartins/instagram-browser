# instagram-browser
Bot that uploads an image into a existing instagram account. To run the bot, you need to create a config.js file in the root folder, with the following structure

```
const config = {
    username: 'your_instagram_username',
    password: 'your_instagram_password',
    imagePath: 'image_you_want_to_upload'
  }
```

after that, just download puppeteer with npm install puppeteer or npm install and type npm run start or node src/index.js
